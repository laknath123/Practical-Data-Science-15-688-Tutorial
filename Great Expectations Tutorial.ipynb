    "## 1.Importance of Data Quality\n",
    "\n",
    "According to a [recent survey](https://www.forbes.com/sites/gilpress/2016/03/23/data-preparation-most-time-consuming-least-enjoyable-data-science-task-survey-says/?sh=77d4a0526f63), data scientists spend around 60 percent of their time cleaning and massaging data. And this aspect of the work is often considered not very desirable.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Data cleaning is not an aspect focused on much in coursework. In most assignments and projects, we receive already cleaned data in CSV files or access to a database and continue to build models and conduct analysis without paying too much attention to data quality issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data we encounter in most real-world data science projects have issues with **accuracy, completeness, uniqueness, consistency, and timeliness**. Furthermore, we may have to work with dynamic data that may get updated daily, weekly, or monthly. Consider building a machine learning model and an analytics dashboard with [311 Data from the NYC open data portal](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Social-Services/311-Service-Requests-from-2010-to-Present/erm2-nwe9). This data gets updated daily, and we have to ensure that the columns in each new update are consistent with what we already have.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most importantly, data quality can adversely impact model quality. For instance, when you are pre-processing a categorical variable to be entered into a model, an inconsistency between ***‘NYPD’ and ‘NyPD’*** would lead these two values to be considered as two distinct categories. But beyond this simple example, data quality issues can adversely impact model performance, and it may be often difficult to detect these issues during the modeling stage. \n"
